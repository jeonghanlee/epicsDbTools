# EPICS Legacy DB Tools

This repository has two EPICS Legacy DB tools such as `dbreport` and `dbVerbose`.
Since these are the legacy tools, which no one care about them these days.

I want to explore the giant itself after standing his shoulder a long time to look
back what the previous generation and brilliant engineers did solve their own problems 
by themselves without having really fancy and super faster developing tools around us.

I still belive their problems exist in every single day of my life currently. 
And I also eagar to find feasiable solutions by myself. 

**Note that the actual functionality of `dbreport` I didn't test. This repository contains
the minimal modification which is needed for the compiliation within the modern Linux
with EPICS 7.0.5** 

## dereport

dbreport - produce a report of  record  information  from  a `.db` file

## dbVerbose

The dbVerbose tool outputs a fully expanded database (i.e. one with all fields of every record listed, even where the field value is identical to the default) to standard output.
